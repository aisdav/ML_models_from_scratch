# 🧠 ML Models From Scratch

This repository contains implementations of classical Machine Learning algorithms **from scratch**, using only **NumPy** and basic Python libraries.

The goal of this project is **deep understanding**, not performance or library usage.

---

## 🎯 Motivation

Many ML practitioners rely heavily on high-level libraries without fully understanding:

* how optimization works
* what model parameters actually control
* why models fail or overfit

This repository was created to:

* demystify core ML algorithms
* build intuition behind training and inference
* strengthen algorithmic thinking for real-world ML problems and competitions
